    "IAM:IAM user without MFA": "Sure! Here's a simple explanation:\n\n1. **What the issue is:**  \nThe IAM user named \"test-user-narmu\" does not have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled.\n\n2. **Why it is dangerous:**  \nWithout MFA, if someone steals or guesses this user\u2019s password, they can access your AWS account easily because there is no extra security step.\n\n3. **What can happen if ignored:**  \nAn attacker could take control of your AWS resources, potentially deleting data, stealing information, or running up high costs.\n\n4. **Recommended fix:**  \nEnable MFA for",
    "EC2:Instance has public IP": "Sure! Here\u2019s a simple explanation of the issue:\n\n1. **What the issue is:**  \nYour EC2 instance (ID: i-0bdbcb6a1f72b571f) has a public IP address. This means it is directly accessible from the internet.\n\n2. **Why it is dangerous:**  \nHaving a public IP opens the instance to potential unauthorized access or attacks since anyone on the internet can try to connect to it.\n\n3. **What can happen if ignored:**  \nIf attackers find security weaknesses, they might gain control of the instance, steal data, or",
    "EC2:Port 22 open to world (0.0.0.0/0)": "Sure! Here's a simple explanation of the issue:\n\n1. **What the issue is:**  \nYour EC2 instance (ID: i-0bdbcb6a1f72b571f) has its port 22 (used for SSH access) open to everyone on the internet (0.0.0.0/0).\n\n2. **Why it is dangerous:**  \nThis means anyone from anywhere can try to connect to your server using SSH, making it an easy target for hackers to attempt unauthorized access.\n\n3. **What can happen if ignored:**  \nAttackers could break into",
    "EC2:EBS volume not encrypted": "Sure! Here's a simple explanation of the issue:\n\n**1. What the issue is:**  \nYour Amazon EC2's storage device (called an EBS volume, specifically vol-0665d32c7fb7a8ade) is not encrypted. This means the data stored on it is not protected with encryption.\n\n**2. Why it is dangerous:**  \nWithout encryption, anyone who gains access to this storage (for example, through hacking or if the physical device is lost or stolen) can easily read the data. This puts your sensitive information at risk.\n\n**3. What can happen",
    "S3:S3 versioning disabled": "Sure! Here\u2019s a simple explanation of the issue:\n\n1. **What the issue is:**  \nThe S3 bucket named **narmu-scanner-backup** has *versioning* turned off. Versioning is a feature that saves multiple versions of files whenever they get changed or deleted.\n\n2. **Why it is dangerous:**  \nWithout versioning, if a file is accidentally deleted or changed, you cannot recover the previous version. This means important data can be lost forever.\n\n3. **What can happen if ignored:**  \nIf someone accidentally deletes or overwrites files in this bucket, you won\u2019t be able to restore them. This could lead to permanent data loss, affecting backups or critical information stored there.\n\n4. **Recommended fix:**  \nTurn on versioning for the **narmu-scanner-backup** bucket in the S3 settings to keep track of all file changes and deletions."
