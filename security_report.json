            "explanation": "The IAM user does not have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled. If the username and password are compromised, an attacker can log in without any additional verification.\n\nIf ignored, this could lead to full account compromise, data deletion, or unexpected billing charges.\n\nRecommended fix: Enable MFA for the IAM user immediately."

            "explanation": "The EC2 instance has a public IP address, making it directly reachable from the internet.\n\nThis increases exposure to scanning, brute-force attacks, and exploits.\n\nRecommended fix: Remove the public IP or place the instance behind a load balancer."
